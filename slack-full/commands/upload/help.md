# gc slack upload

Upload a local file to the Slack channel a session is bound to. By
default the upload is routed through gc, mirroring the text-reply
contract: gc records the upload in the conversation transcript and
fans out a peer notification to other sessions bound to the same
room. Pass `--via adapter` to fall back to the legacy direct-to-adapter
path for diagnostics.

Sessions with no extmsg binding (mayor, chief-of-staff) pass
`--conversation-id` instead: the binding lookup is skipped and the
file posts straight to the adapter, the file-side twin of
`gc slack publish-to-channel`.

Either way the local adapter handles Slack's three-step
files-upload-v2 protocol (`files.getUploadURLExternal` →
`PUT bytes` → `files.completeUploadExternal`).

Use this instead of describing a file in text — Slack renders the
upload inline (image preview, syntax-highlighted snippet, etc.) and
keeps it discoverable in the channel's Files tab.

## Usage

```
# Plain upload into the bound channel, no thread
gc slack upload --file ./out/plot.png

# With a comment that acts as the message body
gc slack upload --file ./out/plot.png --initial-comment "latest run, n=512"

# Threaded under the most recent inbound (parallels reply-current)
gc slack upload --file ./out/plot.png --thread-current

# Threaded under a specific message ts
gc slack upload --file ./out/plot.png --thread-ts 1730000000.123456

# Override displayed filename / title
gc slack upload --file /tmp/raw.csv --filename results.csv --title "Run 42 metrics"

# Bindingless (mayor/cos): explicit channel id, no binding required
gc slack upload --file ./evidence.jpg \
                --conversation-id C0B1NSK4N3T \
                --thread-ts 1234.5678 \
                --initial-comment "camera frame from the incident"
```

## Flags

- `--file PATH` — local file to upload (required).
- `--session SID` — session id whose binding to upload into. Defaults
  to `$GC_SESSION_ID`.
- `--conversation-id ID` — explicit Slack channel id (`C…`, `G…`,
  `D…`). Skips the binding lookup and posts direct to the adapter,
  matching `publish-to-channel`. Implies `--via adapter`; incompatible
  with `--via gc` and `--thread-current` (pass `--thread-ts`
  explicitly). Unlike the binding paths, this mode exits non-zero
  when the receipt reports `delivered=false`.
- `--kind {dm,room,thread}` — conversation kind for the envelope when
  `--conversation-id` is used (`room` default).
- `--filename NAME` — override displayed filename (defaults to
  `basename(--file)`).
- `--title TITLE` — display title in Slack (defaults to filename).
- `--initial-comment TEXT` — comment posted alongside the file. Acts
  as the message body for threading purposes.
- `--thread-ts TS` — Slack message ts to thread under. Mutually
  exclusive with `--thread-current`.
- `--thread-current` — thread under the latest inbound for this
  session, same logic as `gc slack reply-current`.
- `--idempotency-key KEY` — caller-supplied idempotency key for
  retries.
- `--via {gc,adapter}` — routing path. `gc` (default) records the
  upload in the transcript and fans out to peer sessions; `adapter`
  bypasses gc for diagnostics only.

## Required Slack scope

The bot token needs **`files:write`**. Without it the adapter returns
`{delivered: false, failure_kind: "auth", error: "missing_scope"}`
and prints the receipt — no exception is raised. Steps to grant:

1. api.slack.com → your app → **OAuth & Permissions**
2. Bot Token Scopes → add `files:write`
3. **Reinstall to Workspace**

No restart needed; the next `gc slack upload` picks up the scope.

## Identity caveat

Files post under the bot's default identity, NOT the per-session
`chat:write.customize` identity. Slack's file-upload API doesn't
honor that override on the file post itself. If identity matters
more than the file preview, post the file with `gc slack upload`
and follow up with `gc slack reply-current` containing the
explanatory text — that reply will carry the per-session identity.

## How it works

1. Resolves the session's active extmsg binding to find the
   target channel id — or, with `--conversation-id`, uses the given
   id directly (no binding needed) and follows the `--via adapter`
   path below.
2. **`--via gc` (default)** — POSTs the file metadata to
   `/v0/city/{city}/extmsg/outbound-file`. gc verifies the binding,
   hands off to the adapter via the FileTransportAdapter interface,
   appends an outbound transcript entry, and emits an
   `extmsg.outbound` event so peer sessions receive a nudge.
3. **`--via adapter`** — POSTs `{session_id, conversation, file_path,
   filename, initial_comment, reply_to_message_id, title}` directly
   to the adapter's `/publish-file` endpoint. No transcript record,
   no peer fanout.
4. Either way, the adapter handles the three Slack API calls, posts
   to the channel, and returns a receipt with `{delivered, file_id,
   failure_kind, error}`.

## Examples

```bash
# PL session: upload a generated plot threaded under the human's request
gc slack upload --file out/snr_plot.png \
                --initial-comment "snr vs t for 50 inj/rec runs" \
                --thread-current

# cos session: post a status digest with attached CSV
gc slack upload --file /tmp/digest.csv --title "overnight digest"

# mayor session (no binding): attach an evidence photo to the channel
# named in a `Slack address-by-handle` reminder, threaded under the ask
gc slack upload --file /tmp/leo-cam-frame.jpg \
                --conversation-id C0B1NSK4N3T \
                --thread-ts 1234.5678 \
                --initial-comment "live camera frame, taken 00:41Z"
```

Formatting guard: tildes that would accidentally pair into Slack
strikethrough (e.g. "~$58.5k … ~$16.5k" — tilde as "approximately") are
neutralized by default with a visually identical substitute (U+223C).
Deliberate tight-wrapped `~word~` strikethrough, code spans, lone
tildes, and every other formatting character pass through untouched.
Pass --raw to send --initial-comment byte-for-byte verbatim.

Receipt: on success the command prints a terse JSON receipt — delivered
flag, file_id, conversation_id, and thread_ts when threaded (gp-9e7).
A delivered=false receipt adds failure_kind and the error message. Pass
--verbose to print the full result envelope instead.
